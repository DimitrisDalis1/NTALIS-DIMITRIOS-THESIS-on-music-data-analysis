Haven't tried it, but I think you can just run the TTS-Lasso_Regression to test the program.
I have not uploaded the program that creates custom song names.
By using audio_analysis.py you convert our mp3 songs into features which are later stored into our CSV
Since the mp3s are not uploaded (at this branch at least) you cannot use audio_analyis.py but it is essentially our "Converter to usefull stuff" programm
